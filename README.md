# hello-world
First repository, created for work in ENGR 101 at Victoria University.

My name is Christy Gemmell, I am 18 years old and live in Wellington, New Zealand. This is my first time using GitHub.
I have had only a small amount of experience with other VCS's, such as dropbox, so this is relatively new to me.
